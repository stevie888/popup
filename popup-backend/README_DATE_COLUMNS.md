# Adding Date Columns to Umbrellas Table

## Overview
This update adds `created_at` and `updated_at` columns to the umbrellas table to track when umbrellas were added or modified.

## Benefits
- **Audit Trail**: Track when inventory was added or updated
- **Analytics**: Generate reports based on time periods
- **Troubleshooting**: Identify when issues occurred
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure proper timestamp tracking

## SQL Commands to Run

### Option 1: Run the SQL script file (Recommended)
1. Open your MySQL client (MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, or command line)
2. Connect to your `popup` database
3. Run the contents of `add_date_columns.sql` (handles safe update mode automatically)

### Option 2: Run commands manually (Safe Update Mode Compatible)

```sql
-- Add created_at column
ALTER TABLE umbrellas ADD COLUMN created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;

-- Add updated_at column  
ALTER TABLE umbrellas ADD COLUMN updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;

-- Update existing records with specific WHERE clauses (safe update mode compatible)
UPDATE umbrellas 
SET created_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP 
WHERE created_at IS NULL 
  AND id IS NOT NULL 
  AND description IS NOT NULL;

UPDATE umbrellas 
SET updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP 
WHERE updated_at IS NULL 
  AND id IS NOT NULL 
  AND description IS NOT NULL;

-- Verify the changes
SELECT id, description, location, status, inventory, created_at, updated_at FROM umbrellas LIMIT 5;
```

### Option 3: Alternative approach (if Option 2 still gives errors)
Use the `add_date_columns_alternative.sql` file which includes additional safety checks.

## What Changed

### Backend Changes
- Updated API responses to include `created_at` and `updated_at` fields
- Modified database queries to select the new date columns

### Frontend Changes  
- Added "Inventory" and "Last Updated" columns to the umbrellas table
- Updated Recent Umbrellas section to show update dates
- Enhanced data display with proper date formatting

## Features Added
1. **Automatic Timestamps**: New records get `created_at` and `updated_at` automatically
2. **Update Tracking**: `updated_at` changes whenever inventory is modified
3. **Visual Display**: Admin dashboard shows when umbrellas were last updated
4. **Data Integrity**: All existing records get timestamps (using current time)

## Testing
After running the SQL commands:
1. Go to the admin dashboard
2. Navigate to the "Umbrellas" tab
3. You should see the new "Inventory" and "Last Updated" columns
4. Add a new umbrella to test the timestamp functionality
5. Update existing umbrella inventory to see `updated_at` change

## Notes
- Existing records will show the current date as their creation/update time
- New records will have accurate timestamps
- The `updated_at` column automatically updates whenever the record is modified
